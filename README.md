## Description
Recipebook was developed as a platform where users can login with their Google account and post, edit, delete, as well as view other's publicly shared recipes. If allowed by the publisher, users can also leave comments on recipes.


## Origins
Recipebook was imagined, designed, and developed in Santa Monica, CA for General Assembly Project 2. It was initially meant to be a platform that stores recipes that I have laying around at home and keep them in one place where I can look them up from wherever I may be in the world.
